Especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . |1
This is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . |1

A big fat pain . |1

Silly , loud and goofy . |1
The basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . |1
There 's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . |4
It 's not only dull because we 've seen -LRB- Eddie -RRB- Murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . |0
It 's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun . |1
... Jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just is n't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead 's specific gifts . |3

This slow-moving Swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of Martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party . |1
There 's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . |1
Klein , charming in comedies like American Pie and dead-on in Election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . |4
Given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors ' workshop that it is . |1
They kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book . |3
The story is so light and sugary that were it a Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away . |3

Only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate . |3
It 's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller . |1

Yes , I have given this movie a rating of zero . |1
The cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . |1
A close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late . |2
Anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . |1
A wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching . |2
Likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ? |2
None of this is very original , and it is n't particularly funny . |3
shows Holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , -LRB- but -RRB- the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that 's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives . |2
Unfortunately , Kapur modernizes A.E.W. Mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young American , a decision that plucks `` The Four Feathers '' bare . |1

A mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic Jackie Chan to even younger audiences . |4
The respective charms of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant have worn threadbare . |1
There 's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie . |1
Although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . |1
What we get ... is Caddyshack crossed with the Loyal Order of Raccoons . |2
... a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off . |1
Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo . |0
This is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . |2
Half Past Dead is just such an achievement . |0
Feels shrill , simple and soapy . |1
Brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors ... by shoving them into every clichÃ©d white-trash situation imaginable . |4
No amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie 's lack of ideas . |1
The waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . |1

Most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . |1
The movie is n't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . |1
However stale the material , Lawrence 's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny . |1
There 's nothing remotely topical or sexy here . |4
The sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give Blade fans another look at Wesley Snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once . |1
So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic . |3
Reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish . |0
If the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish . |0
Its plot and animation offer daytime TV serviceability , but little more . |1
A film with a great premise but only a great premise . |4
Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other . |2
-LRB- Kirshner wins , but it 's close . -RRB- |3
An ugly , pointless , stupid movie . |1
This is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be . |1
I like it . |0
It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . |1
A rather tired exercise in nostalgia . |1
A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum . |0
Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . |1
The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th Heaven . '' |1
Just a Kiss is a just a waste . |1
A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man 's quest to find an old flame . |2
This is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . |1
It 's easy to love Robin Tunney -- she 's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices . |1

The movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it . |0
Jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of Candid Camera staged for the Marquis de Sade set . |0
Hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity . |3
The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged . |1
The images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . |1
Like a soft drink that 's been sitting open too long : it 's too much syrup and not enough fizz . |1
In the end , The Weight of Water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you 'd expect to see on Showtime 's ` Red Shoe Diaries . ' |0
The re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well . |4

Lawrence should stick to his day job . |3
Despite the fact that this film was n't as bad as I thought it was going to be , it 's still not a good movie |1
The plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution . |1
Too bad Maggio could n't come up with a better script . |1
Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad . |1
Rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to The Rising Place that would set it apart from other Deep South stories . |1
As plain and pedestrian as catsup -- |0
I know we 're not supposed to take it seriously , but I ca n't shake the thought that Undercover Brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary . |3
Much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here . |1
One scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud . |0

Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one . |0

After a while , Hoffman 's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial . |2
The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots . |0
This tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same . |2
When cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy Giannini , Madonna gives her best performance since Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his Dangerous Game . |1
The film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative . |1
The action is reasonably well-done ... yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together . |1
It 's not a bad premise , just a bad movie . |1

Several of Steven Soderbergh 's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . |3
Hmmm ... might I suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ? |1

An instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product . |2
Love Liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit . |3
... tackling a low-budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry . |1
The innocence of holiday cheer ai n't what it used to be . |3
Horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the Serbs themselves but also to a network of American right-wing extremists . |3

This thing is just garbage . |1
A bold -LRB- and lovely -RRB- experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . |4
An uplifting , largely bogus story . |1
Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera . |1
The big ending surprise almost saves the movie . |1
Charming , if overly complicated ... |2
All very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it 's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion . |3
Hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it does n't . |4
Has no reason to exist , other than to employ Hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents . |3
After you laugh once -LRB- maybe twice -RRB- , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot . |1
The overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors . |3
Mr. Goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way . |3
Benigni presents himself as the boy puppet Pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and American Breckin Meyer 's ridiculously inappropriate Valley Boy voice . |1

Sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it does n't . |2
The film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet . |1
Has its charming quirks and its dull spots . |1
The audience when I saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack . |1
You get the impression that writer and director Burr Steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools . |1
But what is missing from it all is a moral . |1
Jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability . |0
... an airless , prepackaged Julia Roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if Lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit . |0
Slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot . |3
The jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . |0
This long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted . |1
It 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` The Loud and the Ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated . |0
When the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails . |2
It would work much better as a one-hour TV documentary . |1
It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . |1
Serving Sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it . |0
What 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy . |1
It plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness . |3
One of those strained caper movies that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends . |2
The ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well I 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong . |3
I 'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about . |1
Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes . |1
So brisk is Wang 's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe . |3
Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin . |1
Sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , -LRB- Ahola -RRB- has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation . |1
A fascinating but choppy documentary . |3
The doofus-on - the-loose banter of Welcome to Collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . |3
This is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September . |0
Gibney and Jarecki just want to string the bastard up . |1
The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . |1
The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie . |0
Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ? |0
Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . |1
Ruh-roh ! |2
A drama ? |3
Ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing . |2
No. . |2
Who , exactly , is fighting whom here ? |2
Overall , it 's a pretty mediocre family film . |1
Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n't feeling any of it . |3
The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . |1
That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . |1
For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new Star Wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one . |3
The director mostly plays it straight , turning Leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . |1
The whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well . |1
It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . |0
At a time when we 've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , Collateral Damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture . |0

The movie is a desperate miscalculation . |0
Uzumaki 's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse ... |2
But this time , the old MIB label stands for Milder Is n't Better . |2
A bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . |1
Starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood-action cliches . |1
It 's too interested in jerking off in all its Byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . |2
Judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women , Foolish Choices for advice . |1
... there 's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . |1
Does n't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by Ralph Fiennes and Jennifer Lopez . |3
It 's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of Janice Beard -LRB- Eileen Walsh -RRB- when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant . |1
Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . |1
So earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script . |1
Not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens . |3
Morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he 's taken one of the world 's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating . |1

Generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it 's not without style . |0
He fails . |0

... a bland , pretentious mess . |0
A bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . |0
It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it . |1
The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone . |3
Although ... visually striking and slickly staged , it 's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated . |3

A movie that ca n't get sufficient distance from Leroy 's delusions to escape their maudlin influence . |1
The movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short . |1
He 's not good with people . |3
But the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work . |0
` Lovely and Amazing , ' unhappily , is neither ... excessively strained and contrived . |1
Amidst the action , the script carries Arnold -LRB- and the viewers -RRB- into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the `` other side of the story . '' |1
Rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue . |1
Kenneth Branagh 's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly British playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in Los Angeles . |3
While it is welcome to see a Chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , Lan Yu never catches dramatic fire . |4
The original was n't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece ! |4

An incoherent jumble of a film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been . |0
The comedy Death to Smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience . |2
The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys . |1
Since the movie is based on a Nicholas Sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things . |1
Bottom-rung New Jack City wannabe . |1

Though Moonlight Mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama . |1
Involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters . |1
An unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse . |2
If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of God , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . |4

The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . |3
Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . |1
The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung . |2
Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money . |4
It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely . |2
An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . |1
It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue . |4
It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . |2
Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite . |1
A decidedly mixed bag . |1
The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . |0
Everything else about High Crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . |1
Sweet Home Alabama certainly wo n't be remembered as one of -LRB- Witherspoon 's -RRB- better films . |4
Even kids deserve better . |1
... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet . |3
`` Sorority Boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . |1
Often likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . |3
Elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . |3
But first , you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort |3
Been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better . |3
What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism . |1
Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . |1
None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens . |0
The kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics . |0
As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them . |3
`` Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . |0
While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration . |1
As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . |1
Starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . |1
The story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . |3
It 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , Mad Cows . |0
This is a picture that Maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . |3
Even as I valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , I could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ... |1
Boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . |4
Oversexed , at times overwrought comedy\/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single . |3
Shafer 's feature does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting . |1
Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . |1
Some Body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves . |1
All the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . |1
-LRB- A -RRB- stale retread of the '53 original . |1
Real-life strongman Ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . |1
Low comedy does n't come much lower . |1
Appropriately cynical social commentary aside , # 9 never quite ignites . |4
One of the most depressing movie-going experiences I can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once . |4
Let 's face it -- there are n't many reasons anyone would want to see Crossroads if they 're not big fans of teen pop kitten Britney Spears . |1
The movie 's vision of a white American zealously spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . |3
Forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . |1
The film 's most improbable feat ? |4
It did n't go straight to video . |0
Whether Quitting will prove absorbing to American audiences is debatable . |1
Family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition ... whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance . |1
Shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom . |1
A Movie to Forget |2
The entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . |1
Watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard . |1
Witless and utterly pointless . |0
With a `` Spy Kids '' sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a `` SNL '' has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling Roberto Benigni ? |1
Instead of trying to bust some blondes , -LRB- Diggs -RRB- should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad . |1
Dismally dull sci-fi comedy . |1
The movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like Chris Rock . |1
The logic of it all will be Greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor . |0
Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . |1
I 've never seen -LRB- a remake -RRB- do anything as stomach-turning as the way Adam Sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates Frank Capra 's classic ... |2
Such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you ca n't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . |1
Like Mike is a slight and uninventive movie : Like the exalted Michael Jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal . |1
There 's some outrageously creative action in The Transporter ... -LRB- b -RRB- ut by the time Frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it 's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . |1
Once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . |3
An ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . |1
This Sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . |1
It 's as if a bored Cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` Got AIDS yet ? '' |1
In a strange way , Egoyan has done too much . |1
He 's worked too hard on this movie . |3
The script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few . |1
A shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and Rocawear clothing . |1
Not only does LeBlanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes . |1
There 's little to recommend Snow Dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . |0
Sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate Jim Carrey who does n't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb . |0
Presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable . |1
Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? |0
I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . |0
The fourth in a series that I 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped ! |0
Its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . |1
more precious than perspicacious |4
Yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma . |1
Perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but `` Serving Sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff . |1
Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual . |1
Piccoli 's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm 's - length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . |2
Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that . |0
There 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . |3
Resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad Blair Witch Project . |0
Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws . |1
Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock . |1
A sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . |2
What begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes . |1
It 's clear why Deuces Wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on MGM 's shelf . |1
Ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clichÃ© of the ugly American abroad , and the too-frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability . |1
A reworking of Die Hard and Cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either . |1
Suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . |1
A film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . |3
Fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . |3
Too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility . |0
Visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay . |1
While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs -LRB- including a knockout of a closing line -RRB- , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity . |1
It has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and R&B names and references . |1
Despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . |3
Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . |1

This is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured Christmas season pics ever delivered by a Hollywood studio . |4
Just bring on the Battle Bots , please ! |2
The Sweetest Thing leaves a bitter taste . |4
A thriller without a lot of thrills . |4
In Moonlight Mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle . |3
`` One look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? '' |1
`` Not really as bad as you might think ! '' |1
It has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . |1
The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish . |1
I suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the DVD . |1
In a 102-minute film , Aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . |3
None of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of Bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . |3
A mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it 's the butt of its own joke . |0
The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . |1
With nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , -LRB- Crane -RRB- becomes more specimen than character -- and Auto Focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . |1
This one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . |1
I walked away not really know who `` they '' were , what `` they '' looked like . |0
Why `` they '' were here and what `` they '' wanted and quite honestly , I did n't care . |4
It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . |1
even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . |2
little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . |1
Watching `` Ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale . |1
Certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . |3
Filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life . |3
Harvard Man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality . |4
Theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . |0
This latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made B movie is long gone . |1
The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep . |3
Such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but Kaufman and Gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go . |1
Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? |1
This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins ' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again , even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . |1
At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . |4
Juliette Binoche 's Sand is vivacious , but it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . |3
Routine and rather silly . |1
Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time . |1
Behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . |3
Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . |1
Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . |1

... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags . |2

It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichÃ©s the filmmakers could dredge up . |1
Nothing but an episode of Smackdown ! |1
It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . |3
` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . |2

The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . |0

The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard 's -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . |3
... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful . |4
Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . |2
This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . |0
overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue |1
Ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . |1
Yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a ca n't - miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . |1
Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? |3
-LRB- Lin Chung 's -RRB- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -LRB- at least to this Western ear -RRB- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . |2
... a rather bland affair . |0
A boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even Kingsley , are made to look bad . |0

It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . |2
` Dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . |1

A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving . |0

Charming and funny -LRB- but ultimately silly -RRB- movie . |3
